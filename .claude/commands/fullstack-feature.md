Develop a complete full-stack feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Multi-Agent Workflow

### 1. Requirements & Planning Phase
- Use the **product-manager** agent to analyze requirements and create user stories
- Use the **documentation-specialist** agent to create technical specifications
- Use context7 and brave-search for market research and best practices

### 2. Architecture & Design Phase
- Use the **cloud-architect** agent to design scalable infrastructure
- Use the **backend-developer** agent to design API architecture and database schema
- Use the **frontend-developer** agent to design UI/UX architecture
- Use the **typescript-expert** agent to design type-safe interfaces

### 3. Security & Performance Planning
- Use the **security-auditor** agent to create threat model and security requirements
- Use the **performance-optimizer** agent to establish performance budgets and metrics

### 4. Implementation Phase
- Use the **backend-developer** agent to implement APIs and business logic
- Use the **database-specialist** agent to implement optimized database operations
- Use the **frontend-developer** agent to implement user interface
- Use the **typescript-expert** agent to ensure type safety throughout

### 5. Quality Assurance Phase
- Use the **code-reviewer** agent to conduct comprehensive code review
- Use the **security-auditor** agent to perform security testing
- Use the **performance-optimizer** agent to conduct performance testing

### 6. Deployment & Operations
- Use the **devops-engineer** agent to create CI/CD pipeline and deployment strategy
- Use the **cloud-architect** agent to set up production infrastructure
- Use the **documentation-specialist** agent to create deployment and operation docs

### 7. Data & Analytics (if applicable)
- Use the **data-scientist** agent for analytics requirements and metrics
- Use the **ml-engineer** agent if AI/ML features are needed

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Complete technical specification and user stories
- ✅ Secure, performant, and scalable architecture
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage and quality assurance
- ✅ Production-ready deployment pipeline
- ✅ Complete documentation and operational guides
