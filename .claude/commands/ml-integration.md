Integrate machine learning capabilities: $ARGUMENTS

## Multi-Agent ML Integration Workflow

### 1. Requirements & Data Analysis
- Use the **product-manager** agent to define ML requirements and success metrics
- Use the **data-scientist** agent to:
  - Analyze data quality and availability
  - Define ML problem type and approach
  - Create data collection and labeling strategy

### 2. ML Research & Development
- Use the **data-scientist** agent to:
  - Perform exploratory data analysis
  - Experiment with different algorithms
  - Create baseline models and validation

- Use the **ml-engineer** agent to:
  - Design ML pipeline architecture
  - Set up model training infrastructure
  - Implement MLOps best practices

### 3. Model Development & Training
- Use the **ml-engineer** agent to:
  - Implement production-ready training pipelines
  - Set up model versioning and experiment tracking
  - Design automated model validation

### 4. Backend Integration
- Use the **backend-developer** agent to:
  - Design ML inference APIs
  - Implement model serving architecture
  - Create fallback and error handling strategies

### 5. Infrastructure & Scaling
- Use the **cloud-architect** agent to:
  - Design scalable ML infrastructure
  - Plan for model serving and auto-scaling
  - Implement cost optimization strategies

- Use the **devops-engineer** agent to:
  - Set up ML model deployment pipelines
  - Implement monitoring and alerting
  - Create automated retraining workflows

### 6. Performance & Optimization
- Use the **performance-optimizer** agent to:
  - Optimize model inference latency
  - Analyze resource utilization
  - Implement caching strategies for predictions

### 7. Frontend Integration (if needed)
- Use the **frontend-developer** agent to:
  - Integrate ML predictions into UI
  - Implement real-time prediction displays
  - Create user feedback collection systems

### 8. Security & Compliance
- Use the **security-auditor** agent to:
  - Review ML model security
  - Assess data privacy and compliance
  - Implement model governance policies

### 9. Documentation & Knowledge Transfer
- Use the **documentation-specialist** agent to create:
  - ML model documentation and cards
  - API documentation for ML services
  - Operational runbooks and troubleshooting guides
