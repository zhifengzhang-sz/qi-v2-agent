Optimize application performance: $ARGUMENTS

## Multi-Agent Performance Workflow

### 1. Performance Baseline & Analysis
- Use the **performance-optimizer** agent to:
  - Establish current performance baseline
  - Identify bottlenecks through profiling
  - Set performance budgets and targets

### 2. Backend Performance Optimization
- Use the **backend-developer** agent to optimize:
  - API response times and throughput
  - Asynchronous processing and queuing
  - Resource management and connection pooling

### 3. Database Performance Tuning
- Use the **database-specialist** agent to:
  - Analyze and optimize query performance
  - Design efficient indexing strategies
  - Implement caching layers and read replicas

### 4. Frontend Performance Enhancement
- Use the **frontend-developer** agent to optimize:
  - Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
  - Bundle size and code splitting
  - Image optimization and lazy loading

### 5. Infrastructure Scaling
- Use the **cloud-architect** agent to:
  - Design auto-scaling strategies
  - Optimize resource allocation
  - Implement CDN and edge caching

### 6. DevOps Performance Monitoring
- Use the **devops-engineer** agent to:
  - Set up APM and monitoring tools
  - Create performance alerting and dashboards
  - Implement performance testing in CI/CD

### 7. TypeScript Performance
- Use the **typescript-expert** agent to:
  - Optimize TypeScript compilation performance
  - Review type complexity and inference
  - Implement efficient type definitions

### 8. Code Quality Impact
- Use the **code-reviewer** agent to:
  - Review algorithmic complexity
  - Identify performance anti-patterns
  - Ensure efficient error handling
