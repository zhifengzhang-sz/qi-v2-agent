# Implementation Status - v0.3.0

## 2025.07.31 - v0.3.0 Release: CLI + Agent with Command, Prompt & Context Continuation

### âœ… Complete Implementation Status

#### Stage 1: Context Continuation Mechanism

ðŸ“ˆ Context Continuation Features Now Available:

  - Conversation Memory: LLM gets previous conversation context
  - Multi-Turn Conversations: Natural conversation flow across multiple prompts
  - Context Switching: Move between different conversation topics
  - Sub-Conversations: Create specialized discussion threads
  - Context Transfer: Move conversation history between contexts
  - Security Isolation: Sub-agents maintain conversation context safely

âœ… **Implementation Status**: Context continuation is now fully working at the agent level. The critical bug in sessionId to context mapping has been fixed, and testing confirms that:

- Same sessions maintain conversation history across multiple prompts
- Different sessions start fresh without previous context
- Context-aware prompting includes conversation history
- Security boundaries are properly enforced

```bash
cd app
bun run test:context
```

**Testing Results**: All context continuation tests pass. The agent properly maps sessions to conversation contexts, includes conversation history in prompts (showing "[WITH CONTEXT]" indicator), and maintains proper separation between different sessions.

#### Stage 2: LangChain Prompt Template Enhancement

**What's Implemented:**

âœ… **LangChainPromptHandler** - Proper template system with 5 built-in templates  
âœ… **Smart Template Selection** - Automatically chooses coding/educational/debugging templates  
âœ… **Enhanced Context-Aware Prompting** - Uses structured messages instead of string concat  
âœ… **Comprehensive Documentation** - Analysis, diagrams, and implementation guide  
âœ… **Test Suite** - Validates the improvements work correctly  

**Testing:**
```bash
cd app
bun run test:langchain
```

The test shows structured messages are generated with proper template metadata, and context continuation works with LangChain templates instead of basic string concatenation.

All documentation is in `app/docs/prompts/` with detailed analysis of the improvements and visual flow diagrams.
