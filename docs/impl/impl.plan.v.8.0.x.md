    - Advanced Concurrency Scheduler (UH1)
    - Context Compression (AU2 algorithm)

    Implementation Strategy

    v-0.8.1 (Immediate Focus)

    - Start with Read, Write, Edit tools as they're foundational
    - Build tool registry and interface standardization
    - Establish testing patterns for tool implementations

    Progressive Integration

    - Each release builds on previous capabilities
    - Maintain backward compatibility
    - Comprehensive testing at each stage
    - Documentation updates with each release

    Architecture Considerations

    - Design all v-0.8.x components to integrate seamlessly with future agent system
    - Use interfaces and contracts that support agent orchestration
    - Build with streaming and async patterns in mind
    - Ensure all components support isolation for future SubAgent system

    This roadmap provides a clear path from current state to agent-ready architecture while
     delivering value at each release.
