**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-01-16  
**Status**: Architecture Decision  
**Classification**: System Design Proposals

## Overview

This document presents two distinct architectural approaches for completing qi-v2-agent before the core agent implementation in v-0.9.x. Each proposal has different implications for development timeline, system complexity, and architectural philosophy.

---

## **Proposal A: Thin Agent + Thick MCP Ecosystem**

### **Philosophy: "Microservices for AI"**

The agent becomes a lightweight orchestration layer that coordinates specialized MCP services. Everything beyond core decision-making and coordination is externalized.

### **Current Status Analysis (Proposal A)**

```yaml
existing_strong_foundations:
  cli_framework: "✅ Production ready (95%)"
  messaging_system: "✅ Advanced implementation (90%)"
  tool_system: "✅ Comprehensive (95%)"
  workflow_engine: "✅ Research-grade (90%)"
  prompt_system: "✅ Multi-provider support (90%)"
  basic_state: "✅ Solid foundation (85%)"
  basic_context: "✅ Excellent foundation (80%)"
  agent_orchestration: "✅ Basic implementation (70%)"
```

### **True Core Components (Internal)**

```yaml
agent_core_only:
  decision_engine:
    current_status: "Partial (in PromptAppOrchestrator)"
    enhancement_needed:
      - "Advanced task planning and decomposition"
      - "Goal reasoning and adaptation"
      - "Multi-step decision making"
      - "Learning from feedback loops"

    enhancement_needed:
      - "MCP service authentication and authorization"
      - "Cross-service permission management"
      - "Security policy enforcement"
      - "Audit trail across services"
  
  agent_communication:
    current_status: "✅ Basic messaging exists"
    enhancement_needed:
      - "Agent-to-agent communication protocols"
      - "Distributed agent coordination"
      - "Message routing and delivery guarantees"
      - "Conflict resolution mechanisms"
```

### **Everything Else → MCP Servers**

```yaml

  memory_management:
    mcp_server: "mcp-server-memory"
    capabilities: ["short_term_memory", "long_term_memory", "state_persistence", "memory_retrieval"]

    mcp_server: "mcp-server-chromadb"
    capabilities: ["vector_search", "document_ingestion", "semantic_retrieval", "knowledge_graphs"]
    rationale: "RAG is a knowledge service"
  
  workflow_execution:
    mcp_server: "mcp-server-langgraph"
    capabilities: ["workflow_orchestration", "pattern_execution", "multi_agent_coordination"]
    rationale: "Workflow execution is orchestration service"
  
  web_capabilities:
    mcp_server: "mcp-server-web"
    capabilities: ["web_fetch", "web_search", "browser_automation", "api_integration"]
    rationale: "Web interactions are external integrations"
  
  database_tools:
    mcp_server: "mcp-server-postgres"
    capabilities: ["sql_query", "schema_analysis", "data_modeling", "migration_management"]
    rationale: "Database operations are external capabilities"
  
  cloud_integration:
    mcp_server: "mcp-server-aws"
    capabilities: ["cloud_deployment", "container_management", "infrastructure_provisioning"]
    rationale: "Cloud platforms are external services"
```

## **Conclusion**

Both proposals are viable with different tradeoffs:

- **Proposal A** optimizes for speed and architectural flexibility

The choice depends on team priorities, timeline constraints, and operational preferences. Both lead to a production-ready agent system, but via different architectural philosophies.

The decision should align with:
1. **Available development timeline**
2. **Team size and expertise**
3. **Performance requirements**
4. **Operational complexity tolerance**
5. **Long-term architectural vision**
