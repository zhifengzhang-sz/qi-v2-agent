# qi-v2-agent Framework Foundation Documentation

**Purpose**: Complete design and implementation guide for building qi-v2-agent framework from scratch  
**Status**: Ready for implementation  
**Timeline**: 12 weeks for complete framework foundation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for building the qi-v2-agent framework from the ground up, based on our established design patterns and architectural principles.

## Framework Vision

### **Core Purpose**
Create an **agent creation framework** with extensible design structures that enable developers to build unlimited specialized agents based on specific workflow requirements.

### **Design Philosophy**
1. **Framework over Fixed Agents**: Enable unlimited agent types through robust design patterns
2. **Security-First Architecture**: Comprehensive security boundaries and permission management
3. **Message-Driven Coordination**: h2A-inspired patterns for all component communication
4. **Tool Ecosystem Excellence**: Rich, extensible tool execution framework
5. **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade logging, monitoring, and deployment capabilities

## Implementation Approach

### **From Scratch Strategy**

This documentation assumes building the framework completely from the ground up, ensuring:

1. **Clean Architecture**: No legacy constraints or technical debt
2. **Design Pattern Consistency**: Uniform application of framework principles
3. **Security by Design**: Security integrated from the foundation
4. **Extensibility Focus**: Every component designed for extension
5. **Production Quality**: Enterprise-grade standards from day one

### **Framework-First Development**

Rather than building specific agents, the approach focuses on:

1. **Core Framework Components**: Message-driven architecture, security, tools
2. **Extension Patterns**: Clear patterns for creating unlimited agent types
3. **Example Implementations**: qi-prompt and qi-code as framework demonstrations
4. **Developer Experience**: Easy-to-use patterns for agent creation

## Architecture Highlights

### **Message-Driven Architecture**
```typescript
// h2A-inspired coordination patterns
interface QiMessage {
  id: string;
  type: MessageType;
  content: MessageContent;
  metadata: MessageMetadata;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Sequential processing with single iterator constraint
class QiAsyncMessageQueue<T extends QiMessage> {
  async *[Symbol.asyncIterator](): AsyncIterator<T>
}
```

### **6-Phase Tool Execution**
```typescript
enum ExecutionPhase {
  VALIDATION = 'validation',
  PERMISSION = 'permission', 
  PREPARATION = 'preparation',
  EXECUTION = 'execution',
  POSTPROCESSING = 'postprocessing',
  CLEANUP = 'cleanup'
}
```

### **Security Framework**
```typescript
interface SecurityBoundary {
  isolationLevel: 'none' | 'process' | 'container';
  resourceLimits: ResourceLimits;
  fileSystemAccess: FileSystemAccess;
  networkAccess: boolean;
}
```

## Development Timeline

### **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (8 weeks)**
- **Weeks 1-2**: Message-driven foundation with h2A patterns
- **Weeks 3-4**: Security framework with comprehensive boundaries
- **Weeks 5-6**: Tool execution framework with 6-phase pipeline
- **Weeks 7-8**: Core tools implementation (file, search, system)

### **Phase 2: CLI and State Management (4 weeks)**
- **Weeks 9-10**: CLI framework with multiple interface support
- **Weeks 11-12**: State management with persistence and events

### **Integration and Validation (Ongoing)**
- System integration testing
- Performance validation
- Binary compilation and distribution
- Documentation and examples

## Success Metrics

### **Framework Completeness**
- ‚úÖ Message-driven architecture operational
- ‚úÖ Security framework enforcing boundaries
- ‚úÖ Tool execution pipeline with 6 phases
- ‚úÖ 8+ core tools operational
- ‚úÖ CLI framework with binary compilation
- ‚úÖ State management with persistence

### **Quality Standards**
- **Performance**: <10ms message processing, <100ms tool overhead
- **Security**: 100% path validation, complete audit trail
- **Reliability**: Zero memory leaks, proper resource cleanup
- **Extensibility**: Clear patterns for unlimited agent types

### **Production Readiness**
- **Binary Compilation**: Standalone executable <20MB
- **Documentation**: Complete API and usage documentation
- **Testing**: >95% test coverage for critical paths
- **Examples**: Working agent implementations demonstrating framework

## Framework Examples

### **qi-prompt Example** (Simple Workflow Agent)
Demonstrates framework capability for bounded-complexity agents:
- Simple, well-defined workflow patterns (max 3 operations)
- Enhanced context management with RAG integration
- Professional CLI with file reference system
- Security boundaries appropriate for prompt applications

### **qi-code Example** (Advanced Workflow Agent)
Demonstrates framework capability for sophisticated agents:
- Advanced workflow orchestration with intelligent pattern selection
- Multi-agent coordination and collaborative problem-solving
- Complete tool ecosystem integration via MCP servers
- Full framework capability utilization

## Next Steps After Foundation

### **Framework Enhancement Phases**
1. **v-0.8.x**: Enhanced context management, RAG integration, model lifecycle
2. **v-0.9.x**: Advanced workflow orchestration, intelligent pattern selection
3. **v-0.10.x**: Multi-agent coordination, advanced decision making
4. **v-0.11.x**: Continuous learning, knowledge evolution

### **Extension Points**
- **Custom Tools**: Clear patterns for specialized tool development
- **Workflow Patterns**: Extensible workflow orchestration framework
- **Agent Types**: Unlimited agent specialization based on requirements
- **MCP Integration**: External service integration patterns

## Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- TypeScript experience with advanced patterns
- System design understanding
- Security best practices knowledge
- Message-driven architecture familiarity

### **Implementation Order**
1. Review [Foundation Design Guide](./foundation-design-guide.md) for architecture understanding
2. Follow [Implementation Checklist](./implementation-checklist.md) for systematic development
3. Validate each phase against success criteria before proceeding
4. Build example agents to demonstrate framework capabilities

### **Team Requirements**
- **2-3 Engineers**: TypeScript, system design, security experience
- **12 Week Timeline**: 8 weeks core infrastructure + 4 weeks CLI/state
- **Quality Focus**: Testing, documentation, security validation
- **Framework Mindset**: Extension patterns over specific implementations

## Framework Philosophy

> **"The concept of dual agents is just stupid, it just shows how little we understand what this project is for. Agent is agent, we can create unlimited amount of agents depends on our concrete workflow. The two agents qi-prompt and qi-code are just examples to show such potential. So the key of the project is to capture the right design structures."**

This foundation documentation captures exactly that: **the right design structures** that enable unlimited agent creation based on specific workflow requirements.
