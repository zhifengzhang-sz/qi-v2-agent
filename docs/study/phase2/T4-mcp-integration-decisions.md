# T4: MCP Integration - Architecture Decisions

## Overview

This guide provides the architectural decision framework for Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration within the Qi V2 Agent. Based on Phase 1 analysis showing 99% complexity reduction through official TypeScript SDKs, this guide focuses on when and how to make integration decisions that leverage SDK benefits while maintaining system requirements.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### SDK-First vs Custom Implementation Strategy

**Decision: Official MCP TypeScript SDK as Primary Integration Method**

**Rationale:** Phase 1 analysis demonstrated that official SDKs eliminate 99% of custom protocol code while providing production-ready features including connection management, error handling, and type safety.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Complexity Reduction**: SDKs replace hundreds of lines of custom protocol implementation
- **Maintenance Burden**: Official SDKs receive updates and community support
- **Feature Completeness**: SDKs provide capabilities not feasible in custom implementations
- **Time to Market**: SDK integration measured in hours vs weeks for custom implementation

**Decision Matrix: Implementation Approach**

| Criteria | Official SDK | Custom Implementation | Decision Factor |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Development Speed** | Hours | Weeks | ✅ SDK |
| **Maintenance Effort** | Low | High | ✅ SDK |
| **Feature Completeness** | Comprehensive | Limited | ✅ SDK |
| **Protocol Compliance** | Guaranteed | Risk of bugs | ✅ SDK |
| **Custom Control** | Limited | Full | ⚠️ Consider need |

**When to Reconsider:** Only when requiring protocol modifications not supported by MCP specification or when SDK doesn't support required transport methods.

### Multi-Server vs Single Server Architecture

**Decision: Multi-Server Architecture with SDK Client Management**

**Rationale:** Different tools serve different domains (file operations, web APIs, calculations), and SDK client management makes multi-server complexity manageable.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Domain Separation**: Specialized servers for specific tool categories
- **Fault Isolation**: Server failures don't affect other tool domains
- **Development Flexibility**: Teams can develop servers independently
- **Resource Distribution**: Load balancing across server processes

**Decision Framework: Server Architecture Selection**

**Choose Multi-Server When:**
- Tool domains are clearly separable (file ops, web APIs, calculations)
- Multiple development teams contributing servers
- Fault isolation is critical for system reliability
- Performance scaling is a requirement

**Choose Single Server When:**
- Simple tool sets with similar domains
- Single development team
- Resource constraints limit process overhead
- Development/testing environments

**Integration Strategy:** Use SDK's built-in client management to abstract multi-server complexity from application logic.

### Transport Selection Strategy

**Decision: Transport Selection Based on Server Deployment Context**

**Rationale:** Different transport methods serve different deployment patterns, and SDK transport abstraction enables flexible selection.

**Transport Decision Matrix:**

| Transport | Use Case | Advantages | Limitations | Decision Context |
|-----------|----------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **stdio** | Local servers, development | Simple setup, reliable | Process management | ✅ Development, local tools |
| **sse** | Web services, cloud deployment | HTTP-compatible, scalable | Requires HTTP server | ✅ Production web services |
| **websocket** | Real-time bidirectional | Efficient, real-time | Complex setup | ⚠️ When bidirectional needed |
| **http** | REST-like integrations | Standard HTTP | No real-time | ✅ Stateless integrations |

**Decision Guidelines:**
- **Default Choice**: stdio for local development, sse for production services
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Deployment environment, performance requirements, infrastructure constraints
- **Migration Path**: SDK transport abstraction enables transport changes without application code changes

## Integration Strategies

### SDK Client Lifecycle Management

**Decision: Centralized Client Management with Lazy Connection**

**Integration Patterns:**
- **Connection Strategy**: Establish connections on-demand rather than at startup
- **Error Recovery**: Rely on SDK's built-in reconnection mechanisms
- **Resource Management**: Use SDK's connection pooling and cleanup features
- **Health Monitoring**: Leverage SDK's health checking capabilities

**Key Decisions:**
- **Initialization Timing**: Connect to servers when first tool call is made
- **Error Handling**: Allow SDK to handle protocol-level errors, catch application-level failures
- **Resource Cleanup**: Use SDK's lifecycle methods for proper connection termination
- **Concurrent Access**: Rely on SDK's thread-safety for multi-request scenarios

### Tool Discovery and Registration

**Decision: Dynamic Tool Discovery with SDK List Operations**

**Integration Approach:**
- **Discovery Method**: Use SDK's listTools() method for runtime tool discovery
- **Registration Strategy**: Register tools with agent framework as SDK clients become available
- **Tool Routing**: Route tool calls to appropriate SDK clients based on tool name
- **Capability Negotiation**: Use SDK's capability reporting for feature detection

**Key Integration Points:**
- **Agent Framework**: Convert SDK tool definitions to agent-compatible tool specifications
- **Error Propagation**: Translate SDK errors to agent error handling patterns
- **Tool Metadata**: Preserve SDK tool metadata for agent decision-making
- **Version Compatibility**: Handle SDK version differences through capability checking

### Error Handling and Recovery Strategy

**Decision: Layered Error Handling with SDK Foundation**

**Error Strategy Layers:**
1. **SDK Layer**: Handle protocol errors, connection failures, transport issues
2. **Application Layer**: Handle business logic errors, tool selection failures
3. **User Layer**: Provide meaningful error messages and recovery options

**Recovery Patterns:**
- **Connection Failures**: Allow SDK automatic reconnection, fallback to alternative servers
- **Tool Execution Failures**: Retry with exponential backoff, report tool unavailability
- **Protocol Errors**: Log for debugging, rely on SDK error recovery
- **Timeout Handling**: Use SDK timeout configuration, provide user feedback

## Configuration Patterns

### Server Configuration Schema

**Decision: Declarative Configuration with Runtime Validation**

**Configuration Strategy:**
- **Schema Design**: Define server configurations that map directly to SDK transport requirements
- **Validation Approach**: Use runtime validation to catch configuration errors early
- **Environment Handling**: Support environment-specific server configurations
- **Security Integration**: Include authentication and authorization configuration

**Key Configuration Decisions:**
- **Transport Parameters**: Provide transport-specific configuration options
- **Connection Settings**: Configure timeouts, retry policies, connection limits
- **Security Settings**: Define authentication methods and access controls
- **Monitoring Configuration**: Enable SDK metrics and logging integration

### Dynamic Configuration Updates

**Decision: Support Runtime Configuration Changes for Non-Critical Settings**

**Update Strategy:**
- **Hot-Reloadable**: Server enable/disable, timeout adjustments, retry policies
- **Restart-Required**: Transport changes, authentication modifications, server URLs
- **Validation Gates**: Prevent invalid configurations from disrupting active connections
- **Rollback Capability**: Maintain previous configuration for error recovery

**Integration Considerations:**
- **SDK Compatibility**: Ensure configuration changes align with SDK capabilities
- **Connection Impact**: Minimize disruption to active SDK connections
- **State Preservation**: Maintain tool availability during configuration updates

## Key API Integration Patterns

### SDK-to-Agent Framework Integration

**Essential Patterns:**
- **Tool Conversion**: Transform SDK tool definitions to agent framework requirements
- **Execution Bridging**: Route agent tool calls through appropriate SDK clients
- **Response Handling**: Convert SDK responses to agent-compatible formats
- **Error Translation**: Map SDK errors to agent error handling patterns

**Integration Points:**
- **Initialization**: Register SDK-discovered tools with agent framework
- **Execution**: Provide tool execution interface that abstracts SDK complexity
- **Monitoring**: Expose SDK metrics through agent monitoring systems
- **Configuration**: Integrate SDK configuration with agent configuration management

### LangChain/LangGraph Integration

**Decision: Use LangChain MCP Adapters for Seamless Integration**

**Integration Strategy:**
- **Adapter Usage**: Leverage official LangChain MCP adapters when available
- **Custom Bridging**: Build custom bridges only when adapters don't support requirements
- **Tool Registration**: Register MCP tools as LangChain tools for agent framework
- **Streaming Support**: Ensure MCP tool results work with agent streaming responses

**Key Decisions:**
- **Adapter Selection**: Prioritize official adapters over custom implementations
- **Tool Metadata**: Preserve MCP tool schemas for LangChain tool validation
- **Error Handling**: Align MCP error handling with LangChain error patterns
- **Performance**: Optimize for LangChain agent execution patterns

## Testing Strategy

### SDK Integration Testing

**Key Decisions:**
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock SDK clients for unit tests, use real SDK for integration tests
- **Test Server Setup**: Use lightweight test MCP servers for integration validation
- **Error Simulation**: Test error handling through SDK error injection
- **Performance Testing**: Validate SDK integration under load conditions

**Testing Boundaries:**
- **Unit Level**: Test application logic with mocked SDK clients
- **Integration Level**: Test SDK integration with real MCP servers
- **System Level**: Test complete agent workflows with MCP tool usage

### SDK Version Compatibility

**Decision: Test Against Supported SDK Versions**

**Compatibility Strategy:**
- **Version Matrix**: Test against minimum and current SDK versions
- **Feature Detection**: Use SDK capability reporting for feature availability
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle missing SDK features gracefully
- **Migration Testing**: Validate SDK upgrade paths
