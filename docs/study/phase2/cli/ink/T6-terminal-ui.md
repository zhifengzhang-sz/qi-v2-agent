# T6: Terminal UI - Architecture Decisions

## Overview

This guide covers key architectural decisions for building professional terminal UI using Ink and React. Focus: component hierarchy strategies, state management patterns, and responsive terminal design decisions.

## Architecture Decisions

### Component Hierarchy Strategy

**Decision: Three-Layer Architecture with Separation of Concerns**

**Architecture Layers:**
- **Layout Layer**: Header, Sidebar, StatusBar, MainContent
- **Interaction Layer**: ConversationView, InputArea, MessageList  
- **Display Layer**: UserMessage, AssistantMessage, ProgressIndicators

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Component Responsibility**: Single responsibility principle for maintainability
- **State Ownership**: Top-down data flow with centralized state management
- **Composability**: Reusable components that work across different contexts
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering with proper React optimization patterns

**Hierarchy Decision Factors:**
- **Terminal Constraints**: Limited screen space requires efficient layouts
- **Real-Time Updates**: Streaming content needs optimized re-render strategies
- **User Experience**: Professional CLI feel with responsive interactions
- **Accessibility**: Clear information hierarchy for screen readers

### State Management Strategy

**Decision: Context + Reducer for Global State, Local State for Component-Specific Data**

**State Architecture Strategy:**
- **Global State**: Conversation, agent connection, UI state, user settings
- **Local State**: Component-specific temporary state (input focus, animations)
- **Derived State**: Computed from global state (filtered messages, UI calculations)
- **Async State**: Custom hooks for agent communication and streaming

**Key State Management Decisions:**
- **State Granularity**: Balance between performance and simplicity
- **Update Frequency**: Minimize re-renders during high-frequency streaming
- **State Persistence**: Which state survives component unmounts
- **Error State**: How to handle and display error states across components

### Streaming Display Strategy

**Decision: Token-Level Streaming with Buffering**

**Streaming Approach:**
- **Real-Time Display**: Show tokens as they arrive for responsiveness
- **Buffer Management**: Accumulate tokens to prevent excessive renders
- **Update Batching**: Group rapid updates using React's batching
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of stream interruptions

**Key Streaming Decisions:**
- **Update Frequency**: Balance responsiveness vs performance (16ms target)
- **Buffer Size**: Optimal token accumulation before UI update
- **Cursor Management**: Show typing indicators during streaming
- **Content Formatting**: Apply syntax highlighting and formatting while streaming

## Integration Strategies

### Agent Communication Integration

**Decision: Event-Driven Architecture with Callbacks**

**Integration Patterns:**
- **Event Subscription**: React to agent streaming events
- **Callback Handlers**: onChunk, onComplete, onError pattern
- **State Synchronization**: Keep UI state in sync with agent state
- **Error Boundaries**: Isolate streaming errors from UI crashes

**Key Integration Decisions:**
- **Threading**: How to handle multiple concurrent conversations
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup strategies for completed streams
- **Performance**: Background processing vs UI thread priorities
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation when agent communication fails

### Input Handling Strategy

**Decision: Multi-Modal Input with Command Detection**

**Input Architecture:**
- **Text Input**: Standard message input with autocomplete
- **Command Mode**: Special commands with `/` prefix handling
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user navigation and actions
- **File Operations**: Drag-and-drop or paste file content

**Key Input Decisions:**
- **Command Parser**: How to detect and parse special commands
- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation before sending to agent
- **History Management**: Input history and recall functionality
- **Multi-line Support**: When to allow multi-line input vs single-line

## Layout and Design Decisions

### Responsive Terminal Design

**Decision: Adaptive Layout Based on Terminal Size**

**Layout Strategy:**
- **Breakpoints**: Define terminal size breakpoints for layout changes
- **Component Hiding**: Hide non-essential components in small terminals
- **Content Prioritization**: Show most important content first
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain functionality across all sizes

**Key Layout Decisions:**
- **Minimum Size**: Define minimum usable terminal dimensions
- **Sidebar Strategy**: When to show/hide sidebar based on space
- **Message Display**: How to handle long messages in narrow terminals
- **Status Information**: Priority order for status information display

### Theme and Visual Strategy

**Decision: Terminal-Native Theming with User Customization**

**Theme Architecture:**
- **Color Schemes**: Support for different terminal color capabilities
- **Typography**: Monospace font optimization and sizing
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Use of color, spacing, and formatting for clarity
- **Accessibility**: High contrast and color-blind friendly options

**Key Theme Decisions:**
- **Color Detection**: How to detect and adapt to terminal capabilities
- **User Customization**: Which elements users can customize
- **Default Themes**: Balanced themes for different use cases
- **Consistency**: Maintaining visual consistency across components

## Performance and Technical Decisions

### Rendering Performance Strategy

**Decision: Optimized Re-Rendering with Virtualization**

**Performance Patterns:**
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle large conversation histories efficiently
- **React Optimization**: Proper use of memo, useCallback, useMemo
- **Update Batching**: Group multiple state updates to reduce renders
- **Background Processing**: Non-critical updates in background

**Key Performance Decisions:**
- **Render Budgets**: Maximum time budget for frame rendering
- **Memory Limits**: Conversation history size limits
- **Update Prioritization**: Critical vs non-critical UI updates
- **Resource Cleanup**: When and how to cleanup unused resources

### Terminal Integration Strategy

**Decision: Cross-Platform Terminal Compatibility**

**Platform Strategy:**
- **Terminal Detection**: Identify terminal capabilities and limitations
- **Feature Graceful Degradation**: Fallbacks for unsupported features
- **Input Handling**: Platform-specific keyboard and input handling
- **Display Optimization**: Optimize for different terminal rendering

**Key Compatibility Decisions:**
- **Feature Matrix**: Which features work on which platforms
- **Fallback Strategy**: How to handle unsupported terminal features
- **Testing Coverage**: Which terminals to test and support
- **Performance Baseline**: Minimum performance requirements

## User Experience Decisions

### Navigation and Interaction

**Decision: Keyboard-First Navigation with Mouse Support**

**Navigation Strategy:**
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Comprehensive keyboard navigation
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order and focus indicators
- **Mouse Support**: Optional mouse interaction where available
- **Command Palette**: Quick access to all functionality

**Key UX Decisions:**
- **Shortcut Conflicts**: Avoiding conflicts with terminal/OS shortcuts
- **Discovery**: How users learn about available shortcuts
- **Consistency**: Consistent interaction patterns across components
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader and assistive technology support

### Information Architecture

**Decision: Hierarchical Information Display**

**Information Strategy:**
- **Priority Levels**: Primary, secondary, and tertiary information
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show details on demand
- **Context Sensitivity**: Show relevant information based on state
- **Status Communication**: Clear system status and feedback

**Key Information Decisions:**
- **Content Density**: How much information to show simultaneously
- **Status Visibility**: Which status information is always visible
- **Error Communication**: How to communicate errors clearly
- **Progress Indication**: How to show long-running operation progress

## Testing and Quality Strategies

### Component Testing Approach

**Decision: Multi-Level Testing with Snapshot Regression**

**Testing Strategy:**
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component behavior and props
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction and state management
- **Visual Tests**: Snapshot testing for layout regression
- **Accessibility Tests**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation

**Key Testing Decisions:**
- **Mock Strategy**: How to mock agent communication and streaming
- **Test Environment**: Terminal simulation for testing
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum test coverage thresholds
- **Performance Testing**: How to test rendering performance
