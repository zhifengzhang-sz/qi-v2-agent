● Perfect! I've identified and fixed the issue. Here's what was happening:

  🐛 Root Cause Found:

  The @file workflow was processing correctly but the enhanced content was being ignored. Here's
  the flow:

  1. User types: @package.json what dependencies do I have?
  2. Workflow detects @package.json → processes file → creates enhanced content with file
  contents
  3. BUG: Enhanced content was emitted as event but orchestrator still processed original input
  4. LLM (OpenRouter) received original input without file content
  5. LLM correctly responded "I don't have access to your package.json"

  ✅ Fix Applied:

  Instead of emitting an ignored event, the workflow now directly sends the enhanced content to
  the orchestrator for processing, bypassing the original input.

  Key changes:
  - Workflow success → sends enhanced content with @package.json file contents included
  - Original input gets replaced entirely
  - LLM now receives: "Based on package.json: {file contents} what dependencies do I have?"

  🔍 Why it worked with Ollama but not OpenRouter:

  This was likely a coincidence - the issue affected both providers equally. The workflow
  processing bug meant file references never worked properly for any provider. If it seemed to
  work with Ollama, it might have been:
  - A different prompt that didn't use @file syntax
  - Cached/previous session content
  - Manual file content sharing

  Now @package.json what dependencies do I have? should work correctly with both Ollama and 
  OpenRouter!
