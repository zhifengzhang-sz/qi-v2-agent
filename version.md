# Version Roadmap

## v-0.1.0 (Completed)
**Initial Design and Planning Phase**
- Complete system architecture documentation
- Technology analysis and comparison
- Development plan with 14-week roadmap
- RAG system design with ChromaDB integration
- Mermaid diagrams for visualization

## v-0.1.1 (Completed)
**Architecture and Plan Updates**

**Added:**
- Simplified 3-layer architecture (eliminated dual-workflow complexity)
- Updated docs/architecture/design.md with LangGraph.js v0.3.11+ features
- Official SDK integration (@langchain/langgraph, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, @langchain/mcp-adapters)
- 2025 MCP security considerations (prompt injection protection, tool permissions)
- Updated Ollama model support (Llama 3.3, DeepSeek-R1, Phi-4, Gemma 3)
- Streamlined data flow pipeline (10 steps → 8 steps)
- TypeScript implementation plan (docs/plan/plan.ts.impl.md)
- Updated memory requirements (512MB → 1GB for Ollama)

**Removed:**
- n8n micro-workflow complexity (over-engineering)
- Custom protocol development requirements
- 14-week timeline (replaced with 8-10 day SDK-first approach)
- Outdated package references ("langgraph" → "@langchain/langgraph")

**Updated:**
- docs/plan/plan.study.md with SDK-first approach and compressed timeline
- Technology stack to use official TypeScript packages
- Risk assessment (High → Low complexity due to official SDKs)
- Development phases from weeks to days

## v-0.2.0 (Completed)
**Phase 1 Complete**
- ✅ Deep study of reference implementations
- ✅ LangGraph + MCP integration analysis  
- ✅ TypeScript SDK trivialization proof (90% complexity reduction)
- ✅ Implementation complexity assessment
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation with verified code examples
- ✅ Updated architecture design (simplified 3-layer approach)
- ✅ TypeScript implementation plan (8-10 day timeline)

## v-0.2.1 (Completed)
**Conceptual Overview and Version Tracking**
- ✅ Added T0: Conceptual Overview for complete Phase 1 study
- ✅ Enhanced study documentation with 2025 technology updates
- ✅ Updated LangGraph features (v0.3.11+, Studio integration, parallel execution)
- ✅ Added MCP adoption statistics (OpenAI, Google DeepMind enterprise usage)
- ✅ Updated Ollama model capabilities (latest models and structured outputs)
- ✅ Enhanced security considerations with 2025 best practices

## v-0.2.2 (Current - Phase 1 Materials Refined)
**Phase 1 Study Consistency Updates**

**Fixed:**
- Removed inconsistent n8n references from plan.study.md alternative approaches table
- Updated "LangGraph + n8n" recommendation to "Official SDK Stack" approach
- Aligned all documentation with simplified 3-layer architecture decision
- Eliminated conflicting workflow approach recommendations

**Verified:**
- All Phase 1 study materials now consistent with architectural decisions
- Technology comparison tables reflect current SDK-first approach
- Documentation accurately represents eliminated complexity through official packages

## v-0.3.0 (Phase 2: SDK-First Foundation)
**Days 1-2**
- Project scaffolding with official TypeScript SDKs
- LangGraph agent creation using createReactAgent (1-line vs 485 custom lines)
- MCP integration via @langchain/mcp-adapters MultiServerMCPClient
- Ollama integration with @langchain/ollama
- Configuration system with Zod validation

## v-0.4.0 (Phase 3: Core Features)
**Days 3-4**
- RAG system with ChromaDB + LangChain integration
- Semantic search and context retrieval
- MCP tool auto-loading and execution
- Streaming responses with real-time UI updates
- Multi-turn conversation support with memory

## v-0.5.0 (Phase 4: UI & Security)
**Days 5-6**
- Professional Ink-based terminal interface with streaming display
- File diff visualization and interactive components
- 2025 MCP security implementation (prompt injection protection)
- Tool permission scoping and audit logging
- Input sanitization and trusted server verification

## v-0.6.0 (Phase 5: Production Ready)
**Days 7-8**
- Comprehensive testing and performance optimization
- Build system and distribution packages
- Installation automation and deployment
- Complete documentation and examples
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

## v-1.0.0 (Production Release)
**Day 8-10**
- Stable, production-ready release
- Complete Claude Code feature parity achieved in 8-10 days
- Professional-grade security and performance
- Community-ready distribution
- ~90% time savings vs original 14-week plan due to official SDK usage
